	 *	This partial file
	 *		- Ensures to raise the right PointerXXX events sequences
	 *		- Handles the gestures events registration, and adjusts the configuration of the GestureRecognizer accordingly
	 *		- Forwards the pointers events to the gesture recognizer and then raise back the recognized gesture events
	 *	
	 *	The API exposed by this file to its native parts are:
	 *		partial void InitializePointersPartial();
	 *		partial void OnManipulationModeChanged(ManipulationModes mode);
	 *		private bool RaiseNativelyBubbledDown(PointerRoutedEventArgs args);
	 *		private bool RaiseNativelyBubbledMove(PointerRoutedEventArgs args);
	 *		private bool RaiseNativelyBubbledUp(PointerRoutedEventArgs args);
	 *		private bool RaiseNativelyBubbledLost(PointerRoutedEventArgs args);
	 *
	 * 	The native components are responsible to subscribe to the native touches events,
	 *	create the corresponding PointerEventArgs and then invoke one of the "RaiseNativelyBubbledXXX" method.
	 *
	 *	This file implements the following from the "RoutedEvents"
	 *		partial void AddHandlerPartial(RoutedEvent routedEvent, int handlersCount, object handler, bool handledEventsToo);
	 * 		partial void RemoveHandlerPartial(RoutedEvent routedEvent, int remainingHandlersCount, object handler);
	 *	and is using:
	 *		internal bool RaiseEvent(RoutedEvent routedEvent, RoutedEventArgs args);
