		// The purpose of dispatchTouchEvent is to find the target (view) of a touch event.
		// When the user touches the screen, dispatchTouchEvent is called on the top-most view, and recursively passed down to all children.
		// Once a view (that we will call target) decides to handle the touch event (generally when it has gesture detectors and none of its children handled the event), it returns true.
		// The parent then gets notified that the event was handled by one of its child, stops passing down the touch event to the siblings of the target,
		// ignores the event (i.e., doesn't handle it itself even if it could), and returns true to its own parent (which bubbles all the way to the top-most view).
		//
		// Essentially, returning true means that you 'handled' (and implicitly also 'blocked') a touch event, where:
		// - blocked -> prevent siblings from handling the event
		// - handled -> prevent parents from handling the event
		// Natively, you can't 'block' a touch event without also 'handling' it.
		//
		// In XAML, the distinction between 'blocking' and 'handling' is important, and a view must be able to 'block' a touch event without necessarily 'handling' it.
		// Therefore, the single boolean offered by dispatchTouchEvent isn't enough, and we must allow UnoViewGroups to communicate these 'blocked' vs 'handled' nuances through some other channel.
		// To do this, we introduce 3 boolean fields in UnoViewGroups: _childIsUnoViewGroup, _childBlockedTouchEvent, _childHandledTouchEvent (each with their own public setter).
		// Because UnoViewGroup must be compatible with native (non-UnoViewGroup) views, we need to process the input (super.dispatchTouchEvent) and output (return) differently based on the nature of the parent and children.
		//
		// Input:
		// - Child is UnoViewGroup (_childIsUnoViewGroup = true) ->
		//     - read the values of _childBlockedTouchEvent and _childHandledTouchEvent (set by the child in its own dispatchTouchEvent)
		// - Child is native (_childIsUnoViewGroup = false) ->
		//     - set both the values of _childBlockedTouchEvent and _childHandledTouchEvent to the value of super.dispatchTouchEvent
		//
		// Output:
		// - Parent is UnoViewGroup ->
		//     - set _childIsUnoViewGroup, _childBlockedTouchEvent and _childHandledTouchEvent on the parent
		//     - return true if isBlockingTouchEvent to prevent siblings from receiving the touch event
		//       (returned value won't actually be read by parent, as it will prefer _childBlockedTouchEvent and _childHandledTouchEvent instead)
		// - Parent is native ->
		//	   - return true if isHandlingTouchEvent
